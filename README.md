# Machine Learning Projects

#### This repository showcases my Machine Learning projects, demonstrating my skills in building predictive models, data analysis, and problem-solving. The projects cover a range of topics, including:
* Regression (predicting continuous outcomes)
* Classification (predicting categorical outcomes)
* Clustering (grouping similar data points)
* Dimensionality Reduction (simplifying complex data)

#### Each project includes:
* A brief description of the problem and approach
* Code in Python, using popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
* Results, including visualizations and insights

#### My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:
* Preprocess and analyze data
* Develop predictive models for regression and classification tasks
* Extract insights and meaning from data

I hope you find my Machine Learning portfolio informative and inspiring! Explore the projects to see my approach and results.
